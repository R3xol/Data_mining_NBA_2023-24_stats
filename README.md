# NBA Player Statistics Analysis (2023/24 Season)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data related to the performance of NBA players during the 2023/24 regular season. The data was sourced from the online dataset available at:  
[Basketball Reference - 2023/24 NBA Player Totals](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_totals.html).

The analysis explores various player statistics, identifies trends, and provides insights into individual and team performances during the season.

- **Data mining File**includes:
  - A detailed description of the dataset.
  - A full analysis of the calculations and insights derived from the data.
- **df.csv**: Data frame in case the page is no longer available.

## Data Source
The data was retrieved directly from the [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com) website, specifically from the NBA totals page for the 2023/24 season. This dataset includes key statistics such as points, rebounds, assists, steals, and other performance metrics for every player.

## Tools and Technologies
